Prompt: (Mordecai going to the moon)

(Mordecai going to the moon) I just want to go." (Mordecai is getting ready to leave)
We enter a room with a big empty chair on it and there is a man on a blanket over a fire station bench.
He's holding a gun. Mordecai glances at him nervously. The fire stations all have guns as they burn.
We find a man with a clipboard in his hand.
"Hi guys." We ask him, he's wearing sunglasses. He picks up some paper, leaves the table, and walks over to Mordecai.
"Come on, buddy."
Mordecai chuckles. He takes this gun-shaped plastic piece and takes more. The gun explodes into a pile of stuff which takes Mordecai out of the room, and is now going to fire a bunch more times in one go, this is why it was a no-brainer. Mordecai is doing fine, now he's killing more monsters. We're finally done talking and he stops firing. We look back and see the gun is gone and it has been sitting on the coffee table for a while. Mordecai and I then sat down in our living room and took out the paper-spills.
Mordecai sits up, and we stare at him, "What are you doing?". He looks more annoyed than angry (as seen below) that he's fired a weapon he didn't even know he was able to use, why was he holding it up as an argument? We can take our guns away, why didn't anyone have them before? The next thing he knows he's having a fight with his girlfriend.
Mordecai walks off.
With us at our disposal I'll go investigate another nearby lake and just be nice to him while we go see if we can get him to change his mind.
This time we're getting some candy. But not candy that has to come from inside the monster.
Mordecai opens up his food cart, then we can see his inventory in it in all his glory, we have our snack.
Mordecai, taking candy out of this cart, picks up a few of our snacks, so we can take him across the ocean. We quickly go back to the house, Mordecai looks at us dumbfounded when we run out of candy, then takes up his phone and speaks to him.
We are now in our room watching TV for a few minutes
