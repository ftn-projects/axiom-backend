Prompt: (Mordecai going to the moon)

(Mordecai going to the moon) and then to enter the Celestial Temple.

The last part of the story, where we first meet Cordelia, is when the Lord of the Rings gives his last wishes to Cordelia's "family" by making the "carnival" of life between them the main part of "the first stage of the story."

We first start to see some pretty basic concepts of the show before we get into much more detail. So in a fair sense, the first four episodes of "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" are the "main stage of the story" but the other four episodes are of much less consequence and perhaps more subtle level. We don't spend a lot too much time on the first two or three episodes of the series though, because in my opinion most of it is more of a story about the "story" over the course of the first few episodes (as if I was saying this before this is the only case where it is an "invention." Which I am not). As such, the "story" is at times the first major point of focus. It is the main "stage of the story." When you make a choice by trying to escape from your father because you don't want to kill him, the choice becomes "Okay, I've already killed a bunch of wolves in the forest, and I don't have any plans for it now. And now all I want is to go and do an evil act." It is always a choice to make during this period, as you may not have gotten the chance to make it through the first few episodes. And I can't think of any way as to how you can be so morally superior to someone when you also have to be an evil person that you would have taken a "good option" to kill. And this is where the major story elements get interesting. This is where there is an awful lot of emotional turmoil because it is the choice of one person that goes into the next that is the defining moment of what character or relationship you truly want to be. In an interesting way, this is the core story of the story.

This is something we have seen the greatest of in "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" – a character named Sallust-de-Rosa that we have a good deal of sympathy for.

One of the fundamental pieces of this "story" is that in order to escape from Mordor, the protagonist must have already died.
