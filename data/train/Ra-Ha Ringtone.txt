This page is the transcript for "Ra-Ha Ringtone".
(The short starts with Mordecai and Rigby outside of Pops' House, sitting on the bottom of the stairs doing nothing but waiting, with their rakes on different spots. Mordecai's rake on the ground, and Rigby's rake leaning on the left stair railing.)
Mordecai: Dude, you know what we should do?
Rigby: What?
Mordecai: We should write a hit song.
Rigby: Dude, we should totally write a hit song.
Mordecai: Yea-yuh, we should!
(Mordecai and Rigby start laughing.)
Mordecai: Okay, okay. Check it out. Just do what I do, and watch the hit song com-a rollin' in.
Rigby: Okay.
Mordecai: ♪Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.♪
Rigby: ♪Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.♪
Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.♪
Mordecai: ♪Ha, ha, ha,-♪
Rigby: ♪-ha, ha, ha-♪
Mordecai: ♪-he, ha, ha!♪
Rigby: ♪He, he, ha!♪
Mordecai: ♪Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!♪
Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, beep, beep, beep, boop.♪ 
(just then, Benson comes into the scene.)
Benson: What are you doing?
Mordecai: (as he and Rigby grab their rakes) Sorry, Benson. We were trying to write a hit song.
Benson: What?
Mordecai: We were trying to-
Benson: I heard what you said! There's no way you two could ever write a hit song.
Rigby: We ca-
Benson: (on-screen) No, you couldn't. I heard some whatever it was you were doing when I walked up, and it- (off-screen) -definitely wasn't a hit song.
Mordecai: Just because you think we can't do it, doesn't mean we can't.
Benson: Hey, Pops.
Pops: (as he comes out though the middle window on his house on top.) Yes?
Benson: Can Mordecai and Rigby write a hit song?
Pops: They could write a song.
Benson: Yeah, but a hit song?
Pops: Oh... No.
Benson: Muscle Man?
Muscle Man: (as seen with holding the lawnmower with Hi Five Ghost by his side.) Yeah, right.
Benson: Skips?
(Skips shakes his head, meaning "no", meaning that Mordecai and Rigby can't write a hit song.)
Mordecai: Oh, yeah? We'll show you.
(Mordecai and Rigby get into their golf cart and drive off to the Really Cool Records Station.They go through the street, swerve off, and then crash into the left side of the R.C.R. station.)
Mordecai: (off-screen) Yo, are you the owner of this record company?
R.C.R. Owner: (off-screen) Yes.
Mordecai: (off-screen) Well, check this out.
Mordecai and Rigby: (off-screen) ♪Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha-♪
(The short then cuts to Mordecai and Rigby being carried out of the station by two guards.)
Mordecai: Aww! Oh, okay! Okay, were leaving!
(The two guards throw Mordecai and Rigby out of the station, then the short cuts to Mordecai and Rigby back at the park.)
Mordecai: Uh... Okay... We can't write a hit song...
Benson: Are you finished now?
Mordecai and Rigby: Yes...
Benson: Good. Now get back to work, or you're both FIRED!!!
Rigby: Aw, man. I guess we're not good enough to write a hit song.
Mordecai: Yeah... But I bet we're good enough to come up with an awesome ringtone.
Rigby: Dude, we're totally good enough to come up with an awesome ringtone!
Mordecai: Yeah, we are!
(Mordecai and Rigby start laughing again.)
Mordecai: ♪Ra-ha, ringtone, pick up your phone.♪
Rigby: ♪Ra-ha, ringtone, pick up your phone.♪
Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Ra-ha, ringtone, pick up the phone, ra-ha, ringtone, pick up your phone! Ra-ha, ringtone, pick the phone! Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, beep, beep, beep, boop. Pick up your telephone, because you hear your ringtone!♪
Mordecai: Woooah!!
Rigby: Woooah!!
Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha-ha.♪
Benson: (When he appears again) GET BACK TO WORK!!!!
(Mordecai and Rigby bump into each other, and then they pick up their rakes off the ground, and then go back to work, ending the short.)
