(Epiaode begins at Pops' house. Mordecai, Eileen, Benson, Pops, Muscle Man and Skips are throwing a party in honor of Rigby.)
All except Rigby: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Rigby: Ahem. Thanks for coming, guys. As you all know, this is a big day for me. I've been here at the park for a long time now. I've spent a good chunk of my life up in that room, but it's time for a change. You don't grow by standing still. I've decided it's time to say goodbye... to Trampy. (We cut to Rigby's trampoline with three balloons on it saying "Goodbye!", Happy Retire-ment" and "SO LONG" along with a photo framed showing Rigby lying on his trampoline). 
I just had to say, "Rigby, you're a man now. It's time for a change." Also, I won a sweet new bed in the 82nd annual "Hotdog Horf" this weekend. (Pulls out a newspaper with an image of Rigby stuffing his face with two hotdogs, the title of the newspaper "LOCAL MAN DEBASES SELF, WINS BED")
Pops: What will become of old Trampy?
Rigby: I'm gonna send her off in style.
(We cut to the back of Pops' House where the gang are standing near the dumpster)
Rigby: Does anyone wanna say a few words?
Skips: Can we wrap this up? There's lot of pipes in the park that need snaking.
Rigby: Right, sure.
(Rigby gets onto Trampy, takes a deep breath, bounces on Trampy and does some flips. Everyone watches Rigby in awe as he continues doing flips. Rigby curls up in a ball and lands pefectly.)
Rigby: In style.
