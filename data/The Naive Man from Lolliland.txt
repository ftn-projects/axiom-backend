[On a black background, there is white text saying "The Naive Man From Lolliland". It then cuts to black, and another white text appears saying "A Film by JG Quintel". It also cuts to black. Cut to Pops finishing his meal]
Pops: [opens his newspaper] Let's see what's in the newspaper. [cut to newspaper] "Ambassador from Lolliland visits the United States for the first time."
[camera zooms into a picture of Pops walking off a plane]
Pops: [off-screen] Hahaha! [on-screen] I say, good show. Very good show.
[Waiter walks to Pops]
Pops: I say, why, the handsome chap in the newspaper, don't you think?
[The newspaper shows Pops and Pops chuckles a little bit.]
Waiter: Uh, sure. I'll be back in a second for the check.
[Pops folds the newspaper and looks at the check]
Pops: Let's see here... I think... 25 percent tip, yes, jolly good show, jolly good show deserves jolly good tip I always say.
[Pops puts some lollipops in the bill]
Waiter: Can I get you any change sir?
Pops: No, no. It's all for you my good man, uh..., top notch service.
Waiter: Wow. Thanks, sir! Very generous of you.
Pops: Oh well, good day, young man.
[Pops walks away and the waiter opens the bill to see lollipops in there]
Waiter: [off-screen] Hey! Hey, you! Stop! [on-screen] What the hell?!
Pops: Excuse me?
Waiter: Is this some kind of a joke?
Pops: [on-screen] No joke. Look. [off-screen] 2 Spearmint, 1 Root Beer, and [scoff][on-screen] Butterscotch Ripple. Young man, the sum I left here is ample. It's more than enough to take care of the bill, and substantial lump left over for yourself, I might add.
Manager: What's going on here?
Waiter: Gramps here is trying to pay with lollipops!
[Pops throws his lollipop and it breaks a window]
Pops: I don't believe this! That's a starry tip I left you, Vile Cad!
Waiter: I don't care what flavor it is. I'm not taking candy from some [off-screen] lollipop headed FREAK!
Pops: Bad show... bad..., bad... show... I refuse to take any more of this... This... abuse. Gentlemen..., I take my leave.
[Pops bumps into the chef]
Chef: He's not finished talking to you yet.
[The chef pushes Pops into a table]
Pops: Okay, Okay..., I don't want any trouble.
Waiter: That's right, PAY UP!
Pops: Yes, sir. [Pops stares at a chair] Let me get my... bill fold...
[Pops grabs the chair and hits the waiter then the manager and the chef tackle Pops then Pops leaves the restaurant and gets in a taxi]
Pops: Drive, Benson. Take me away from this..., horrid place.
Benson: Yes, sir.
[The car is driving then it starts flying]
Pops: Goodbye, United States. I hope one day, we become friends.
[The short ends with credits]
