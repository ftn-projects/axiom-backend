[The Episode starts out with Mordecai and Rigby playing a video game]
Mordecai: Get ready dude, this is the final fight.
Rigby: Okay okay, I got it I got it.
Mordecai: Are you sure you know what to do this time?
Rigby: Yes. It's like one, two, start, blah, blah, something, whatever.
Mordecai: Dude, it's one, two, start, then four, one, and two, at the same time.
Rigby: Like this? [taps controller keys]
Mordecai: No, not now! Wait 'til I tell you to do it.
Video Game: Ice this fool!
Mordecai: Now dude, do it now!
Video Game: K.O.!
Mordecai and Rigby: Wooooooahhhh!
Rigby: Did you see me deliver that kill blow? That fool never had a chance.
Mordecai: Congratulations Rigby, you finally finished level one.
Rigby: And it only took me seventeen games. Which is my new record. Come on, let's go, I wanna see what I can do on level two.
Mordecai: Uh, no thanks dude. I think I've had enough video games for one day. [begins channel flipping] Ugh, there's nothing on.
Rigby: Wait, go back!
Mordecai: Wuh?
[Rigby snatches remote]
Mordecai: Hey, wait!
Rigby: Here! [flips to channel]
[Cut to commercial]
Voiceover: Get ready gamers, to have your minds kill-blown!
[Teenage boy puts controller glove on]
Voiceover: It's the only game controller you'll need for the rest of your life!
[Teenage boy plays with controller glove]
Voiceover: The Maximum Glove, maximum power, maximum cool!
[Teenage boy smashes door, walks up to television in the room]
Boy: What the heck is that?
Teenage Boy: Haven't you been watching the commercial you idiot? It's the Maxmimum Glove. Huh!
[Boy's eyes are set on fire]
Boy: My eyes!
Voiceover: The Maximum Glove won't hit shelves 'til next fall but you can win it now by entering the Game Inferno Tournament. This weekend at the Ferguson Con Center, teams of two will battle for the ultimate prize. So sign up with a friend and go maximum. The Maximum Glove!
Teenage Boy: It's so bad.
[Explosion behind the teenage boy. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby]
Rigby: (in awe) Dude. Two player video game tournament. We totally gotta enter so we can waste those losers and win that glove! Woo! (chanting) Maximum! Maximum! Maximum! Maximum! Maximum! [Pans to Mordecai who looks apathetic] Maximum! Maxi-ehh... Dude, what's wrong with you? Why aren't you saying maximum?
Mordecai: I don't know, it wasn't that cool.
Rigby: Wasn't that cool? Those kids' eyes burst into flames just from looking at it! How is that not cool? C'mon dude, we have to do this!
Mordecai: No, let's just forget about it-
Skips: Hey Mordecai, let's get outta here pretty soon-
[Mordecai makes a throat slashing gesture]
Skips (continued): I don't wanna be late for the Video Game Inferno Tournament.
Mordecai: [facepalms] Ugh!
Rigby: What?
Skips: I'm gonna go pack. [skips away]
Rigby: Why are you gonna go with Skips? He doesn't even play video games!
Mordecai: He's good. He's been practicing lately and-
Rigby: Yeah, but Skips isn't good enough to win the video game tournament with you. Here's what you have to do: lose Skips, we enter the tournament, we win the glove and everybody wins. Skips'll understand.
Mordecai: Dude I can't just switch, that's messed up.
Rigby: Dude, just switch and enter the tournament with me!
Mordecai: No.
Rigby: Dude, SWITCH! (voice breaking) Please, why are you doing this to me?! [walks up to Mordecai]
Mordecai: Dude, NO! [pushes Rigby away] I'm not switching back.
[Rigby begins to cry quietly]
Mordecai: Look, why don't you just come to the video game tournament with us? It's gonna be fun.
Rigby: [sniffles] Okay, I'll come.
Mordecai: Cool, get your stuff together, we're hitting the road in an hour.
Rigby: (with fake cheeriness) [laughs] Yeah. [laughs] (maliciously) Oh, I'll get my stuff together. And then I'll get you to pick me to be your partner instead of Skips. You'll see.
[Scene cuts to a short montage of Skips, Mordecai and Rigby driving in a VW-style van]
Rigby: Hey Skips, want some of my trail mix?
Skips: [takes some trail mix] Thanks Rigby.
Rigby: [scoffs down the rest of the trail mix] (maliciously) Oh I'm sorry Mordecai, did you want some? I guess I should've asked you if you wanted some before  asking Skips if he wanted some, 'cause I know you like trail mix so much, but I guess it's too late 'cause I already gave it all to Skips 'cause I asked him first.
(brief pause)
Skips: So, Mordecai, I was thinking about going over some strategy before the tournament. Should I work on my A B A A -
Rigby: Hey. Do you guys mind if I put in my mixtape?
[Mixtape begins to play]
Rigby: (on the mixtape) Why do friends not pick their friends to enter a video game competition with them when they know that they would wanna be in it? I guess it's because they just don't wanna win it. You should've picked me, do the right thing, you better pick me before we get to this stupid tournament-
[Doorbanging on mixtape]
Mordecai: (on the mixtape) Dude, what are you doing in there? C'mon, we gotta get on the road.
Rigby: (on the mixtape) Just a minute! They never pick their friends, they never pick their friends, they never pick their friends, they never pick-
[Cuts to a diner where two men are seated]
Man 1: Thanks again for picking me as your teammate for the Game Inferno Tournament.
Man 2: Dude of course, you're my best friend. Who else would I pick?
[Pans to Mordecai, Rigby and Skips]
Rigby: (aggressively) You know, I think it's great that I can be here to support you guys. In fact, I'm so supportive, I made you both matching uniforms for the tournament. [pulls out a box] One for Mordecai,- [throws a shirt at Mordecai] -and one for his valued teammate Skips. [throws a shirt at Skips]
Mordecai: Uh, thanks Rigby, it's great.
Skips: Mine doesn't fit, plus there's an R on it.
Rigby: Oh, yeah. I guess Skips doesn't start with an R. But hey, if you don't wanna wear it, I can wear it, totally not a problem for me. What do you say Mordecai, should me and Skips switch?
Mordecai: Uh. [yawns] I think we should head back to the hotel and get some rest.
Rigby: Yeah, let's do that. [walks off]
Skips: Uh.
Mordecai: What?
[Cuts to outside of hotel. Rigby is standing on top of the van with a boombox playing the mixtape from before]
Rigby: (on the mixtape) Why do friends not pick their friends to enter a video game competition with them-
[Pans to Mordecai covering his ears with his pillow]
Rigby: (on the mixtape) -when they know that they would wanna be in it?
[Scene cuts to the Ferguson Convention Center. Mordecai walks up to a registration table]
Mordecai: Hi. Uh, is this where we register?
Man: Here's the registration form. The first two lines are for player one and two, the third line is for the alternate.
[Mordecai writes on the form and walks up to Skips and Rigby]
Mordecai: Hey Rigby, I've got good news!
[Rigby gasps happily]
Mordecai: I put you down as an alternate.
Rigby: What? Why?
Moredcai: C'mon dude, I'm just trying to win the glove.
Rigby: Then why did you pick Skips? He's not even good at video games!
Moredcai: Dude, cool it.
Rigby: Why would you pick Skips over me?! He's HORRIBLE at video games!
Mordecai: No, he's NOT! [shoves Rigby to the ground]
[Crowd collectively oohs)
Mordecai: Rigby, I picked Skips because you're horrible at video games!
Rigby: Fine, (gets up from the floor) forget you then! I hope you have as much fun winning the glove as you did losing your best friend. [Rigby storms out]
Mordecai: Rigby!
Skips: I know what you're doing Mordecai and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed in you.
Mordecai: [sighs] Look, Skips, I wanna win the Maximum Glove for me and Rigby to share, but I just can't play with him. He's not good enough at video games to win.
Skips: Mordecai, I know you wanna make Rigby happy by winning that glove, but are you sure you're going about this the right way?
Mordecai: Don't worry about it, he'll get over it when we in the glove. Let's go.
[Cut to montage of Mordecai and Skips beating people in the tournament until the final round]
Referee: Gamers, this is the final match! The winning team will get to take home the Maximum Glove!
[Maximum glove rises from the ground]
Referee: Players to your stations!
Game: Three, two, one, fight!
[Mordecai and Skips play. Mordecai sees a sad Rigby in the crowd leaving]
Rigby: (voiceover) What do you say Mordecai, should me and Skips switch? Why aren't you saying maximum? Why would you pick Skips over me?! Dude, SWITCH! Why are you doing this to me?! I hope you have as much fun winning the glove as you did losing your best friend.
Mordecai: Wait, time out.
[Whistle blows and crowd gasps]
Mordecai: Skips, I can't do this. Not without Rigby.
Skips: Yeah, it's about time you changed your mind.
Mordecai: You mean you're cool with stepping out?
Skips: Oh, yeah. These video games are too easy anyways.
Referee: Sir, what's the trouble?
Mordecai: Uh, my friend hurt his hand. He can't play.
Referee: His hand looks fine to me.
Skips: [punches a pole] Wanna check again?
[Cut to the outside of the Ferguson Convention Center]
Mordecai: Rigby! Wait!
Rigby: [turns around] Why aren't you inside playing?
Mordecai: I need my teammate, the one I should've asked in the first place.
Rigby: Huh?
Mordecai: I want that glove, but I want my friend back more.
[Mordecai and Rigby shake hands]
Mordecai: Let's go win that glove, dude!
[Cuts to the match]
Game: Game on!
[Fred and Jimmy snigger]
Rigby: Time for the kill blow! [taps the wrong button] Oh, no!
[Fred and Jimmy snigger again]
Rigby: Oh, no, man, you were right Mordecai - I really am bad at video games! Now we're gonna lose and not win the Maximum Glove because of me!
Mordecai: It doesn't matter, dude! I'm just glad I get to play with my best bro!
Rigby: Really?
Mordecai: Yeah! It's not about winning, it's about having fun!
[Game begins to vibrate, Mordecai and Rigby are surrounded by a blue aura and teleported into a dark space with a giant Maximum Glove]
Giant Maximum Glove: Congratulations, you've figured it out. You're the first gamers to realize that hanging out with your friends is more important than a stupid glove.
Mordecai and Rigby: Cool.
Giant Maximum Glove: As a reward, I will grant you maximum gaming power. Are you ready to be maximized?
Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Giant Maximum Glove: MAXIMIIIIIZE! [surrounds Mordecai and Rigby in yellow beam]
[Mordecai and Rigby return to the match with a fused together body. The crowd gasps]
Skips: Urgh!
[Fred and Jimmy gasp, the Referee vomits]
Mordecai: Let's finish this.
[Mordecai and Rigby vicously play the game]
Game: Eliminate them!
Mordecai and Rigby: MAXIMUM POWEEEEERRRR!!! '[hits the game]
[Game explodes]
Referee: [emerges from rubble] Behold, the new winners of this year's Game Inferno, Mordecai and Rigby!
Skips: Yeah!
[Mordecai and Rigby hold up the Maximum Glove. Cut to the house]
Mordecai: You go first, dude.
Rigby: [puts on glove] Aww, yeah. So cool.
[Racing game starts and Rigby moves the glove around. Cars on the screen do not move.]
Mordecai: Dude, why aren't you moving?
Rigby: I don't know.
Mordecai: Did you type in the code?
Rigby: Yeah I typed in the code. It's not doing anything.
[Car falls off cliff]
Rigby: Dude, this controller blows.
[End of Video Game Wizards]
