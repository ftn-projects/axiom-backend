(The short begins with Mordecai and Rigby flying through space on a Synthos ship looking bored.)
Rigby: (groans) This thing's been stuck on autopilot forever! How long 'til it takes us back to Synthos?
Mordecai: Four hours, just like the last time you asked.
Rigby: AUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!! (puts his feet on the ship's control panel, but one of his feet presses a button, making a musical note)
Mordecai and Rigby: Huh?
Mordecai: Do it again, do it again.
(Rigby presses the button twice, the two giggle as Rigby continuously presses the button, then they both press buttons that makes synthetic music, then they press a button that activates a disco ball-like beacon as the two follow it and dance to the music, then they stop when they see a synth dragon sleeping as it wakes up, puts on shades and starts playing on his keyboard-like snout that shoots a musical beam out of its mouth. Mordecai and Rigby put on sunglasses and continue to press buttons and dance to the music. They're now floating in space and sliding down a keyboard and continue to press buttons as the synth dragon continues playing and gives them a thumb us as the music ends and they're back on the ship)
Mordecai: Fade it. (Rigby slides a control knob that ends the music) Nice!
(The duo high five and laugh)
(End of Synth Buttons)
