(The episode begins at the park morning meeting)
Benson: And Mordecai and Rigby, let's have you pick up trash over by the snack bar.
Rigby: Ugh! Again?
Benson: Don't worry, this is the last time you'll be on trash duty for a while.
Mordecai: Awesome! Wait, we're not getting another intern, are we? 'Cause I don't know if I can handle another spy situation.
Benson: No, I've actually got some very big news about your dome-estic situation!
(everybody stares at him)
Benson: Hopefully it won't cause too much pan-dome-onium!
(everybody continues to stare)
Benson: Dome you have any ideas about what's going to happen?
(everybody is still staring)
Benson: No one, huh? Well, since I have to spell it out for you, Maellard's decided to seal off the park in a dome to create a contained ecosystem! A group of scientists from the government is going to study it for a whole month!
Muscle Man: Bro, have would we ever have guessed that?
Mordecai: A whole month? Where are we supposed to go?
Benson: You'll have to move out, the dome's dropping tomorrow! Isn't that exciting?
Pops: Why aren't you more upset about the inconvenience?  
Benson: Because I don't live at the park.
Skips: So we can stay at your place?
Benson: Heh, well, my place, while officially a one bedroom, (the wind starts blowing strong) feels more like a studio. So there isn't really any room! (he looks up and sees a dome coming down onto the park)
Hi Five Ghost: It's not tomorrow! It's today! They're sealing the park today!
Muscle Man: Grab your valuables!
(everybody runs, as Benson looks up, not happily, we see Rigby take a load of pizza pouches, Mordecai takes some tapes and his TV, Muscle Man takes what seems to be a load of letters from his dad, Pops opens a safe with lollipops inside and Skips waters his plants, everybody starts to run)
Muscle Man: She's gonna seal! (the dome is seen getting closer to the ground) Lighten your loads! (he throws a load of letters away)
(Mordecai drops the bag with the TV inside, everybody continues running, Rigby then throws the pizza pouches ahead and jumps forward, but the dome seals, and Rigby jumps into it)
Rigby: Ow!
Muscle Man: (banging on glass) Grrr! Live free or die!
(everybody starts complaining)
Benson: Hey guys! Let's relax, okay? Like I said, they're not sealing the dome 'till tomorrow.
Hi Five Ghost: (angrily) Are you blind, man?! Can you not see that the dome has been sealed today?!
Benson: Calm down! Look, here comes Maellard now, I'm sure he can clear this whole thing up.
(a limo arrives and Mr. Maellard comes out of it)
Benson: Maellard! (Mr. Maellard points to his head and nods) Oh, okay! (Benson receives a phone call) Maellard! So the test run's looking pretty successful on our end! (he knocks on the dome) Good fit! Looks like we're in good shape for tomorrow! (he ends the call) See? So you can all-(he receives another call) Maellard again. (he answers) Benson speaking. (another limo arrives behind him) Oh, but I don't get dates wrong! (he looks behind him) And the dome is going to stay where it is for the next 30 days. (Mr. Maellard is seen speaking, then a scientist passes him a bag of money, he then hangs up) So...
Skips: We figured it out.
Rigby: This isn't fair!
(The guys complain again. Zoom in on Benson's face, full of anger and confusion.)
Benson: (to himself) I got the date wrong? But I'm me, Benson!
(He shakes he head in disbelief.)
Benson (continued): Emergency meeting, my office, now!
(Cut back to Pops' house.)
Benson (continued): So I'm sure you all know why we're here.
(All the park members, except Muscle Man, are in Benson's office.)
Skips: To figure out how to survive in a dome for a month?
Benson: To look at the e-mail I got form the dome guys and prove I was right about the drop date.
(Everyone else, except Pops, groans.)
Benson (continued): You won't be groaning when you see (turns computer around) this!
(The power goes out. Pops shakes his head as everyone else groans again.)
Benson (continued): It's okay. I've got a printed backup version.
(He turns to his file cabinets.)
Mordecai: That's not what we're mad about.
Rigby: You really print every email?
Benson: Yes, I do, for this exact type of situation. So it's not like you can make fun of me because I wasn't prepared. Yep, you can't off the power to my physical mail, or as I call it, my p-mail.
Mordecai: (groaning) We don't care.
Skips: Is your p-mail gonna feed us for a month?
Pops: I'm scared!
Rigby: I'm hungry!
Benson: Listen, I'm sure you'll all calm down when you see...
(He pulls out a printed email.)
Benson: What the...What's this?
Mordecai: You were wrong about the date. Now, can you please just help us?
Hi Five Ghost: We really need leadership right now.
Benson: No, this isn't right. It's all wrong!
(Muscle Man enters.)
Muscle Man: Do not go into the bathroom. The water has been cut off as well.
Rigby: Do you hear that?
(Everyone but Benson mumbles as they walk up to the window. A sound of a rocket is heard and dome pods appears flying in, dropping packages on parachutes.)
Mordecai: What are those things?
Hi Five Ghost: They're dropping packages!
Skips: Let's take a look.
Benson: Now wait just one...
(Everyone runs out, leaving Benson.)
Okay.
[DOOR OPENS, SHUTS]
I'll just hang back,
sort this date thing out.
[SIGHS]
I can't believe it.
I-- Was I really wrong?
Wait.
This paper stock...
It has a much finer
tooth than mine.
And it's slightly off-white
to boot.
Hmm.
Oh, what the--?
I can't believe--
The watermarks aren't even
the same font!
They tried
to make a fool out of me.
I've been so blind.
[SCOFFS]
I'm gonna blow
this thing wide open.
[PANTING]
Guys! Wait till you see
this paper stock! Huh?
Cool! Custom jackets
with our names on them.
Hey, those are
pretty sharp.
Excuse me!
If we keep
things rationed,
this should be enough food
for the month.
I don't normally like seeds,
but in the dome--
Those aren't for eating.
They're for planting, dude.
Oh. That explains
why they're unsalted.
Hello? Are you even
listening to me?
We're being actively lied to
about the date!
Sometimes the better man
admits when he's made a mistake.
You guys really
don't believe me.
Your thing is
the least of our problems.
Hey, uh,
so I was thinking,
we should write up a full
inventory of these supplies.
Is that a good idea,
Benson?
Uh, Benson?
Huh? Uh, sure.
You go ahead
with all that.
I got to
go do something.
Okay. Sounds good.
[♪♪♪]
[GRUNTS]
[KEYS JINGLE]
Ah!
[INHALES SHARPLY]
Rolled on my keys.
Aah!
[BUZZES]
Uh, I mean, caw! Caw!
[BEEPS]
Huh?
It vanished.
It was
right in front of me.
Where on earth--?
[GRUNTS]
Whoa. Another dome?
[BIRD SCREECHES]
[SQUAWKS]
I know.
I didn't see it either.
And why is it camouflaged?
Jeez.
Pretty high security.
Something is fishy here.
I want to see
what's going on in there.
Why do they have my picture?
Someone's coming.
[WHIRRING]
Armed guards
and a laser-beam door?
They really don't
want visitors.
Wait. Of course.
It's so obvious.
That must be where
they've hidden my p-mail.
I better go tell the guys
about this.
Maybe we can overpower them,
and I can clear my name.
I like you, bird.
I think
I'll call you...Antares.
Huh?
[SCREECHES]
Antares, you coward!
Hey...
[GROANS]
What?
How long have I been out?
Judging by my stubble growth,
I'd say 76 hours.
Brr. I'd better
get back to the house.
It's probably pretty dire
over there without me.
Oh, Benson!
You're okay!
We were
worried about you.
I'm fine, Pops.
I just need to call a--
Is that a garden?
Mm-hmm. We ran out of food,
so we're growing our own.
Living off the land has been
quite invigorating.
Huh. Living
off the land, huh?
Looks like you two are really
contributing to the cause.
Actually,
we're on break.
Hey, guys,
I appreciate
you putting in
the hours earlier.
Getting up at dawn
isn't easy,
but those latrines
are looking tip-top.
Hey, no thanks
necessary.
Yeah.
Just happy to do our part.
Is that my clipboard?
Oh, hey, Benson.
Ha, ha.
Yeah, it's funny,
but I suppose
I've kind of become the de facto
leader in your absence.
Everyone's really
coming to their own
as a contributing member
of the dome-munity.
Now that you're back,
I guess you
want this back.
Yeah, sure.
Look, everyone listen.
I have something very important
to show you
pertaining
to my p-mail.
Benson, it's okay.
Nobody cares about that anymore.
Yes, Benson. We've grown
quite fond of the dome.
Look, I know you all still blame
me for being stuck in here,
so just come with me, and
I'll prove it wasn't my fault.
[GROANS]
Fine.
Let's just
get this over with.
This can't be.
It was right here.
I'm telling you, there was
a whole other dome,
just like the big one,
but little, with trees on it
and lasers.
It's okay, Benson.
Come back with us
to the camp,
and we'll set you up a hammock
in the meditation tent.
I don't need
your pity hammocks.
What's going on here?
Why are you being
all weird and supportive?
Did the dome people
get to you?
Benson, chill.
You can trust us.
Stay back!
I trust no one!
Benson, wait!
Let him go.
The dome affects us all
in different ways.
They'll see.
These dome guys
are up to something,
and I'll prove it,
even if it takes me all month.
[♪♪♪]
I'm ready.
♪ Dome, dome-dome, dome, dome ♪
[♪♪♪]
Time to blow this thing
wide open.
[WHIRS, THEN DINGS]
[BENSON WHISTLES]
Huh?
Darn birds got in again.
[GRUNTS]
Ooh!
[GRUNTS]
[WHIRS, THEN DINGS]
I hear the whole thing
will be blasting off
in a couple months.
Well, assuming Steffen
can get his act together.
Huh?
What the--?
Oh...my...
My p-mail's not up there.
Come on. Come on.
It's true.
It must all be true.
I'm gonna blow this thing
wide open.
[IN GERMAN ACCENT]
Benson Dunwoody!
Park manager, former drummer,
stick-hockey enthusiast.
I...am Dr. Dome.
Welcome to my domicile.
I don't care
who you are.
I think we both know
what's going on here.
I can see you've accurately
surmised our plans.
I knew to look for your backup,
for I, too, print my e-mails.
Just in case.
Is that my p-mail?
Our plans have surely
been made apparent to you
by this point.
Why we put a dome
over the park
and pumped it
full of oxygen.
Why we created a self-sustaining
environment within it.
Why we switched the date
on your e-mail.
Why we--
Aha!
So you admit
you did change the dates!
And I've got the proof
right here!
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
Ja.
Of course we did.
As you know,
that's part of the test.
Perhaps the data
isn't as compromised
as we initially thought.
Yeah, wait, what are
all these blueprints for?
[SNAPS]
Huh? Unh!
Ah.
No!
What the--?
Steffen, come on.
It is a very simple
user interface.
Antidote dart,
knockout dart.
Remember what I just showed you
because it is important.
[GROANS]
Do you think
he'll tell the others?
Only one way
to find out.
Oh, be careful up there.
How you guys doing?
Well, we
just about finished
with the new
irrigation system.
You guys are doing
great work.
Here. I don't want you guys
to get dehydrated.
BOTH: Thanks, boss.
Looking good, Pops.
Thank you.
Good, you're back.
Any luck?
Yeah, bad luck.
We couldn't
find him.
This isn't good.
What do you think
we should do?
Hmm... Yep, okay.
Let's all go out
in an organized search party.
Hopefully we can find him
and talk to him calmly.
Now, remember our mantra.
ALL:
The dome affects us all
in different ways.
Great. Let's go.
Everybody,
please stick together.
RIGBY:
Guys, I think
I found something.
[♪♪♪]
Benson?
He's waking up.
Where...am I?
He's still unstable.
Benson,
are you all right?
We found you passed out
in the forest.
Are you okay?
What? Yeah, I'm...
RIGBY:
Is there anything
you wanna tell us?
Huh?
RIGBY: Any big secrets?
Really cool headband,
Benson.
Seems like
you've been through a lot.
What happened?
Well, ahem,
now that you mention it,
I-I was doing
some recon.
Actually came across
some very earth-shattering--
Hey, has that mirror
always been there?
Oh, that old thing?
Never mind that.
Now, you were saying
about your time in the forest?
Yeah, tell us more, sir.
Sir?
[GRUNTS]
What did you call me?
[GASPS]
Hey, Benson,
is there something wrong?
Maybe you should
lie back down.
Would you like
a popsicle?
Uh, sorry, guys.
Think I'm still feeling
a bit rattled from everything.
Say, remember that game
we used to play
that always made me
really comfortable
and let my guard down?
Of course.
What was it again?
The close our eyes game
where we all close our eyes.
Sure, sure.
Okay.
[GRUNTS]
[PANTING]
What the--?
Oh, no, bro!
Benson,
it's me, Techmo.
BENSON:
Oh, come on.
I barely know you!
Benson, slow down.
I'm your girlfriend
Audrey.
BENSON:
We broke up months ago!
Benson!
Benson, bro,
where are you?
Benson!
Hey, guys.
Whoa! Why are you
lurking in the bushes?
Oh, right.
I don't normally do that.
[LAUGHS]
I guess I got mixed up
and took a wrong turn.
Speaking of mix-ups, now that
the gang's back together
and everything's
back to normal,
I wanted to tell you
it turns out
I actually did get
the date wrong on that e-mail.
[LAUGHS]
I apologize for
making such a fuss.
BOTH:
You apologize, huh?
Yep. After all, you know
your old pal Benson's motto:
"Don't sweat
the small stuff."
He's a fake!
Get him!
Aah!
What the heck
is this?
Where's
the real Benson?
I'll never tell.
[GRUNTING]
Please,
go back to your house.
Dr. Dome is not gonna--
[WHIRRING]
Huh?
[SCREAMS,
THEN GRUNTS]
Benson!
Is it really you?
This whole month
has been a lie.
They're not studying the park,
they're studying us!
Also, I was right
about the dates,
and I was right
about the second dome,
and you should never
have doubted me!
It's definitely him.
So, what do we do?
We're gonna take back
our free-dome.
To the dome cycle.
[♪♪♪]
Orders from on high
said compromised data
must be destroyed.
Dome let them
get away.
Is that
a bow and arrow?
Yes.
[BOTH SCREAM]
Weather control,
give me freezing rain.
Yes, sir.
[BEEPS]
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
[ALL SCREAMING]
Hold on.
ALL:
Ooh.
Benson?
Didn't that
hurt your knees?
Aah!
Aah!
Behind us!
Look out, he's got a dart--
[BOTH SNORING]
[BOTH GASP]
Fire! Fire all
of your darts!
[BOTH GRUNT, THEN SNORE]
[BOTH GASP]
Ow!
Dude.
[BEEPS]
Ow!
Huh?
[BEEPS]
Huh?
I thought
I was doing a good job!
[BEEPS]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[ALL SCREAMING]
[WHISTLES]
[COOS]
[SCREECHES]
[BOTH SCREAM]
[SCREECHES]
[IMITATES SCREECH]
Press the moon button
on your drones.
[BEEPING]
[SLURRING]
We're almost out.
[GROWLS]
[BEEPS]
We can still
make it, bros!
[BEEPS]
[ALL GROAN]
DR. DOME:
You are our test subjects.
You cannot escape the dome.
Even if you
blow that thing open,
you would never
be able to fit.
You would have to
blow that thing,
like, really, really wide open.
[GASPS]
I'm gonna blow this thing
wide open.
No! Dome you see
this is bigger than you?
This is bigger
than all of us!
Hyah!
Aah!
Huh?
[LAUGHS]
You missed me!
Did I?
What?
[CRACKLING]
[GASPS]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Dome it all to hole.
[SIGHS]
[ALL PANTING]
It's the final frontier!
There may be another layer
of dome around this one.
Everybody weapon up.
[WEAPONS RINGING]
Congratulations.
Maelard?
You finished
the experiment.
But just barely.
If you'd escaped
even a minute sooner,
we'd have had to
start over again.
So the plan was
to trap us in there
with no warning
all along?
I suppose there's no harm
in admitting now that yes,
I played you for fools and won.
But why?
I'm afraid I can't divulge
the goal of the experiment.
No, Maelard.
You tell us
what this was all for.
You tell us right now!
Tell us!
[ULULATES]
All right!
The experiment was a test
to see how the park
and its employees would do
in a zombie apocalypse.
In space?
Seriously?
That's too cool
to be true.
He thinks he can
still play us for fools.
He doesn't understand
how much we've all grown
from this experience.
The truth this time,
Maelard.
You owe us the truth.
I told you the truth!
Papa, please.
Eh, fine.
I just felt like
buying a big dome
to put on the park
because I'm rich.
Finally,
an honest answer.
I'd probably have done
two domes.
You know, so it would look
like a huge butt.
Well, back
to my mansion.
BENSON:
You're not done here, Maelard.
The e-mail.
Admit to everyone
that you changed the date!
Yeah, I changed the date.
So I was right,
everyone!
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
I was right!
